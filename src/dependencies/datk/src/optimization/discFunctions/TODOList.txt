// TODO items:
1) Implement k-Facility Location (Weighted k-uniform matroid rank function) -- Kai
2) Implement sparse graph facility location -- Rishabh
3) Implement Clustered Submodular function (part of it is currently there, but implement the full one) -- Rishabh 
4) Implement Core Set functions (Pairwise Sum distance, pairwise min distance, min spanning tree distance) -- 
5) Implement Log-Det Function -- Rishabh
6) Change the combineSubmodularFunctions to combineSetFunctions -- Rishabh
7) There may be a bug in facilityLocationSparse.eval(), when the set to be
evaluated is large, the glibc memory issue pop up. We need to work it out in
the future. 
8) The bug is with the facility location sparse: (1) eval method does not
work. Basically, the function has a problem of deleting the vectors. Whenever
it tries to delete stuff, there reports a glibc error. Similarly, in the test
code, whenever we try to destruct the function, it will report this error. The
error only occurs when k >= 5% of n, which is very weird!
9) Finish copy constructor, destructor, clone, assignment operator for each subclasses of functions. So far, we finished setFunctions, submodularFunctions, featureBasedFunctions. Need to finish for others.
